Milvus-based storage

## Install and Run Milvus
Milvus provides an installation script to install it as a docker container. The script is available in the Milvus repository. To install Milvus in Docker, just run
```
bash script.sh
```

After running the installation script:

- A docker container named milvus has been started at port `19530`.
- An embed etcd is installed along with Milvus in the same container and serves at port `2379`. Its configuration file is mapped to `embedEtcd.yaml` in the current folder.
- To change the default Milvus configuration, add your settings to the `user.yaml` file in the current folder and then restart the service.
- The Milvus data volume is mapped to `volumes/milvus` in the current folder.
